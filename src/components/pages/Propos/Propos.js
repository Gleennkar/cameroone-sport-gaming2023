      <h2>A propos de Cameroun E-SPORT </h2>
      <p>
        Africa Esports Championship was born from a handful of African esports
        enthusiasts who came together out of a shared passion for esports and a
        commitment to grow economic opportunities for Africa’s youth while
        putting African esports industry on the global map. We envision an
        Africa built by collaboration with African citizens across the world,
        and the wider public in general. Esports provides an opportunity to
        enable and empower African youths economically and socially with the
        larger goal of transforming lives. The Africa esports community in
        Africa is fast-growing with the esports eco-system spawning numerous
        opportunities for skills building and income generating activities
        across the industry including; Players, Castors, Event Organizers,
        Talent Managers, Media distribution, Content Creators and more. We are
        looking to partner with brands, industry leaders and institutions across
        the globe to develop the esports industry in Africa through Tournaments,
        Education, Technology, Community Building, Entertainment, Tourism and
        Content Distribution. We are looking to partner with brands, industry
